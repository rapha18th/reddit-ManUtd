3,"With Tottenham beating Man City and still having two games in hand, we really need to get a win against Leeds. The end of our schedule is going to be very hectic so we can’t afford to drop points in the games that are totally winnable.",It was a great performance from TOT. So sharp with finishing.

26,"I think Cavani will be on the bench, mostly because you'd be crazy not to start him against City with his work-rate. He compensates a bit for Ronaldo's lack of defensive contribution. 

Rashford--Ronaldo is a fearsome front two. As long as we can defend, Bruno can be relied upon to create enough opportunities for those two. 

I think we'll really, really want to get a two-goal lead in this game. Aside from the obvious, we'll want to have the freedom to bring off Bruno and Ronaldo at 70-75 mins. Can't afford to have either fatigued against City.",Enjoy,1,2021-11-01 12:50:03

40,This was our strongest lineup last seasons and we won many games with this lineup and now just because we signed varane and Sancho and they can't start against Leeds people are overreacting like we are gonna play with our 3rd or 4th team against Leeds. We belted Leeds last season with these players only and we will have a good game again against them I'm pretty sure.,Exactly how I'm feeling.

Now watch Arsenal or Villarreal turn in to prime early 2000 AC Milan against us.","I want Villarreal. I don't know about you. Arsenal just feels like a bogey team and plus it will give us fans a chance of watching Pau Torres without having to go out of our way to find a game of theirs. Arsenal isn't a good enough opponent for me to judge Pau Torres against. I'd like to watch him against world class players, such as Paul Pogba, Bruno Fernandes, and Edison Cavani. Hope he doesn't fuck up his audition though.",3,2021-05-05 16:15:33
47,"One of my, and I'm sure for a lot of you guys, best memories as a United fan with this fixture.


While seven would be nice again, a comfortable 2-0 win would be just as good. I think Pogba will start on the bench and come on after he's broken his fast to wreak his havoc.","I remember how afraid I was of the return quarter leg because we had lost 2-1 at Roma, but then it was all pure bliss, what a display we put on at OT. Carricks insane goals that match I'll never forget",3,2021-04-28 15:00:32

On the flip side it'd be nice to see combinations like Mata and Van de Beek playing together against Leicester and maybe see Amad in a PL game too",Leicester lost yesterday too. A win tomorrow puts us 7 points clear with a game in hand. Even if we lost to Leicester and Liverpool we’d go into the last 2 games above them. We have Fulham and Wolves.

59,"As we learned against Leipzig, sitting back with a back 5 doesn't necessarily make us any better defensively. I'm hoping Ole keeps that in mind.",Having a healthy Bailly is huge because it allows us to play a back four and be a bit risky; he’s a freak and will chase the ball down or easily cut out the pass if they try and play it in behind to Salah and Mane.,1,2021-01-16 11:47:54

63,"Martial will start but I feel like he’ll struggle. People will want Greenwood to start but he’ll immensely struggle as well.

99,I'm terrified of Sevilla. Europa League are just seems to be in their blood. Going to be a decent match though,"Basis only Wolves game, they didn't create a lot. A lot of possession but little to show for. Feels like our team 10 months back. Plus we have just enough firepower to get through... So yeah decent match but I expect us to come out as winners... Unless they press us hard...",3,2020-08-15 14:10:05
