""I saw the goal of H \[Maguire\] and I see Paul running behind him, sliding on his knees, happy for him. I was slapping his head, saying **finally you've scored a goal with that big head**.""

🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 I'm dead!!!",1
1,I hope Elanga will start ahead of Rashford.,1
2,"Glancing at Brighton's form and they have drawn 12 games - more than any other Premier League side this season - and drew with three of the top four clubs they have already played at...

\[Insert Groundhog day Gif\]

3,"With Tottenham beating Man City and still having two games in hand, we really need to get a win against Leeds. The end of our schedule is going to be very hectic so we can’t afford to drop points in the games that are totally winnable.",3
4,I swear this has felt like the longest breaks of breaks ever,1
5,"Vardelof please

Elanga please

Win please",1
6,Hopefully Ronaldo was angry with himself and did hours of finishing training in his back yard.,3
7,Hang tight boys. We signed up for this. It must get worse before it gets better. It's a new system. Good days are coming. The bitter pain of this season will hopefully get sweeter soon.,1
8,Another vdb Hattrick incoming (not 3 consecutive goals but 3mins of playtime),3
9,Why is victors family always a target wtf,3
10,Got tickets to go see this with my mum as one of her Christmas presents. If we play like we did against wolves she's gonna think I fucking hate her,3
11,Jon Moss.... Yikes. He will let Burnley play Rugby. No Bruno either. Burnley held Chelsea to a draw. Gonna keep my hopes low for this game. Hope both Cavani & Ronaldo start,3
12,"I know Nuno's gone but I still get a shiver when I see United v Wolves, those games during 2019 and 2020 scarred me lmao",0
13,FINALLY. JUST ONE MORE DAY.,1
14,"Chelsea probably the best team in the country and possibly Europe at the moment.

Manchester United with a great squad but having a torrid time.

Manager sacked.

New manager not coming until Monday.

It’s one of them games where every logical thing points to a Chelsea victory, so that means we’ll win.",1
15,I wouldn't be surprised to see Elanga start,3
16,"As Ralf has only literally 1 training session with the boys, I hope with his insightful analysis, we can see some changes to how we play. Not too much but yeah you know what I mean.",3
17,"Sancho and VdB need to play after their performances on Saturday, they were the only bright sparks.",3
18,Hope Ronny can bag a hat trick. Really want him to catch up to Salah or at least come close.,3
19,"Arteta has never lost to Manchester United, we need to fix this.",3
20,"We can only climb up to 5th on GD above Arsenal, if we win and they lose to Liverpool.

We could theoretically drop to 13th.",0
21,"See this'll be nice because I can wake up at 5:00 a.m., fix myself an espresso and ruin my entire weekend as early as possible.


(Edit: I'm a plastic or whatever living in Seattle)",0
22,This game has been officially postponed.,3
23,"Gonna be there in person for the first time in 2 years, sitting 5th row from the corner flag in the east stand... I cannot fucking wait and am dreading it at the same time

Don't think we change formations, we never do. Would love to see that 433 but matic would not be able to cope with the pace as a lone dm

Job under threat ole is a mythical creature and I hope he feels it tomorrow more than ever and we steamroll the scum.

Let's fucking do this, always the biggest game of the year",3
24,"----------------De Gea-----------------

AWB--Henderson-Heaton-Grant--Shaw

Dalot--Varane-Matic-Maguire--Telles",0
25,Early kickoff means either you enjoy the rest of the weekend matches without a care in the world or end up ruining your time off from work. Lest see how it is this time around.,1
26,"I think Cavani will be on the bench, mostly because you'd be crazy not to start him against City with his work-rate. He compensates a bit for Ronaldo's lack of defensive contribution. 

Rashford--Ronaldo is a fearsome front two. As long as we can defend, Bruno can be relied upon to create enough opportunities for those two. 

I think we'll really, really want to get a two-goal lead in this game. Aside from the obvious, we'll want to have the freedom to bring off Bruno and Ronaldo at 70-75 mins. Can't afford to have either fatigued against City.",1
27,After much meditation I am ready for WILDCARD Bailly,3
28,Winning is not enough. We need to control games otherwise it is not sustainable. You need to be semi competent even if you wish to shithouse results all the way to semis or finals.,0
29,Not getting cocky for shit. It happened against Young Boys and it happened against Aston Villa. And being optimistic is one thing but I genuinely have no idea how some of you are saying we are going to smash them.,3
30,Can we pick up Neves on our way back?,3
31,Fuck the international break. This thread feels so good.,3
32,"Ever since Ronaldo came back, I am not worried endlessly but actually confident and cocky we can win every match. Ronaldo has reached that level where his presence can alter destiny, he is our Iron Man.",0
33,>Wankdorf Stadium,1
34,"We will have the pleasure of watching Martin Atkinson, Jonathan Moss and Mike Dean, all within one week.",3
35,Time for a Sancho masterclass,0
36,Fuck me I’ve missed the premier league,3
37,Our back six are starting to look familiar,1
38,"Final pre-match thread of the season! Hope you've all enjoyed participating in them as I have in making them. 

Will be back for pre-season!",1
39,"I kinda want to see Pellistri, not seen much of him barring a couple clips while on loan.",3
40,This was our strongest lineup last seasons and we won many games with this lineup and now just because we signed varane and Sancho and they can't start against Leeds people are overreacting like we are gonna play with our 3rd or 4th team against Leeds. We belted Leeds last season with these players only and we will have a good game again against them I'm pretty sure.,3
41,"Has now been confirmed van de Beek and Dalot will be on the bench tomorrow. Bruno and Deano won't be involved despite both returning to training.

Scotty 'could push for an outing' but nothing confirmed from Ole.",1
42,"The team won't be as weak as people are anticipating, will definitely be stronger than the one in the OP imo",0
43,If we start Cavani against defenders like Kabak and Rhys Williams the FA will ban him for child abuse,0
44,lets hope its not another dreary 0-0. Lets beat them proper to confine them to thursday night football.,0
45,Fuck Lamela,1
46,"PSG and Real absolutely wetting the bed these semifinals. Very poor display from both. 

Now watch Arsenal or Villarreal turn in to prime early 2000 AC Milan against us.",3
47,"One of my, and I'm sure for a lot of you guys, best memories as a United fan with this fixture.


While seven would be nice again, a comfortable 2-0 win would be just as good. I think Pogba will start on the bench and come on after he's broken his fast to wreak his havoc.",3
48,"I think we will potentially sacrifice the Leicester game by playing  a full strength team against Villa and Liverpool and playing our bench strength against Leicester

On the flip side it'd be nice to see combinations like Mata and Van de Beek playing together against Leicester and maybe see Amad in a PL game too",3
49,Man Utd u23 vs Portugal u23,3
50,"This will be the first Old Trafford game with fans since Scott McTominay smashed in a 2nd goal from 40 yards in the Manchester Derby.

And I will be there. Can't wait.",3
51,"Hope we can wrap this game up tmrw and then rest a few players next week. 

That being said it’s not going to be a easy game. Boys better be up to it. Our only chance of winning a trophy this season",3
52,It’s going to be a strange time when we don’t see Phil Jones with an unknown injury.,3
53,"Thankfully Kavanaugh, the worst official in the league, who just gave one of the worst red cards I've seen this season against West Ham, will not be officiating out match tomorrow

Instead we'll get some other shit ref",3
54,[deleted],1
55,"Whatever the result, one things absolutely certain innit?

The games gone, absolutely gone! :P",3
56,"You know, for the first time in FOREVER I find myself asking “why would Pogba want to leave?”

Juventus are in dire need of a rebuild. Same with Barcelona. Madrid’s a good fit but I don’t think they want him. It seems like he’s in a classic “grass isn’t greener...” situation here.",3
57,Just win.,3
58,"Both Everton and Chelsea have dropped points. Win this and we get some massive breathing room.

I don't think I can handle a 'top 4 is lava'  race this year.",1
59,"As we learned against Leipzig, sitting back with a back 5 doesn't necessarily make us any better defensively. I'm hoping Ole keeps that in mind.",1
60,"Front three of Rashy, Greenwood and James since Cavani and Martial didnt travel. Probably Pogba on the bench, but I am sure they will start Ibra, Theo, Hakan. Gonna be a tough one boys.",3
61,"I always want to be positive, but I feel it's either going to be a drab 0-0 or we'll get dicked.

Hopefully this will act like reverse psychology and we'll pull off a masterclass. If they go for it and we counter well then we've got a chance.",1
62,"Have a weird feeling we'll see a monster game from ~~Tony~~ Amad. Hope I'm right, would love to see a couple goals from him 🙏",3
63,"Martial will start but I feel like he’ll struggle. People will want Greenwood to start but he’ll immensely struggle as well. It’ll be 3 CB’s against 1 striker, a two striker formation might be more suitable for this game.",3
64,"The FA Cup semi final draw will be at halftime of our game against Leicester. This is how it’ll go: 

* If Leicester are winning tomorrow (pls no but let’s assume for the sake of the scenario), the winner of our tie will be drawn against Southampton.

* If the game is delicately poised and level at the break, we’ll be drawn against the winner of Chelsea/Sheffield.

* If we’re winning at halftime, we’ll be drawn against the winner of Everton/City.

Bookmark it.",0
65,"Don't want to see Rashford on the right ever again. If our RW is gonna be shit, put Greenwood, Dan James, Mata, Van De Beek or even Diallo out there. Don't sacrifice one of our most talented players by throwing him out of position.",0
66,4-0 Greenwood Hattrick,0
67,We’re conceding early aren’t we?,1
68,Another clean sheet to send George Klopp into full meltdown,3
69,"A win here would mean Pep Guardiola loses and
#I LOVE TO SEE THAT SHIT",0
70,What are your predictions on how many times the commentators will mention Jack Grealish's calf muscles?,3
71,No complacency boys. Sheffield may be bottom of the pile but they’re still playing with a lot of spirit. We’re in great form so don’t let this turn into a bogey game.,0
72,"For the beauty of the game I hope we beat Burnley and liverpool. Even if we somehow crash and lose the title race, I want to feel the thrill and agony of being in a title race, it's been 8 years ffs",3
73,"Nervous as fuck for this game :/ dont want a fancy comeback now, just want us comfortably winning this game without a heart attack",0
74,Liverpool and Chelsea dropped points. Anything but a win is a failure. Newcastle is fucking wank. Hope our players don't get carried away with the win against Real Sociedad,3
75,"We have 10 points from our last 7 games.

Tomorrow is a must win! We shouldn't slip into the top 4 dog fight. I'll be satisfied if we finish the season 2nd with at least 76 points.",1
76,Nice of these match threads to keep reminding us that Phil Jones is still on our payroll.,1
77,"Reminder that in the UK this game is being shown on amazon prime and that you should not stream this illegally. Amazon are a company that seriously needs your money to keep offering this service, on top of your Sky and BT subscriptions. After his divorce, Jeff is now down to his last 187 billion and I would really hate to see him slip to #2 in the world rich list.",3
78,No way Amad starts but i would love to see him get a solid 30 minutes of action. Greenwood should start. A goal or two in the first half and all the pressure will be off for some youth cameos in the second half.,3
79,People are underestimating Fulham. They have been playing some good football. This isn't the game to rotate imo,3
80,Just win. I don’t care how. Manchester can only be red.,3
81,[removed],0
82,"I really don't know what the line up will look like aside from Lindelof - Tuanzebe partnership. Gonna be an interesting match for sure, hopefully Ole doesn't make necessary subs at the 88th minute. Having a nice feeling about this though",3
83,"Can totally see cavani scoring the winner tomo and neymar with the shocked neymar face reaction..

Also 🐍 will be pissed..

I am all for it",3
84,"- Tottenham Lost
- Chelsea Lost
- Leicester Lost
- Man City Drew
- Southampton Drew

Lets win against Sheffield & Leeds and get to the 2nd position. 

We have a great chance this time.
Let’s go for the PL lads!",3
85,"It's been a while. Just batter them lads come on.

Work for a company in Leeds, Monday morning's call could go either way.",3
86,"Cavani has to be rested, the team has just had a break of two days and Martial didn't play for a minute. Healthy rotation please.",1
87,"If we win this, I think this'll be a big turning point for us in the season. Love a game against Arsenal honestly, most of my mates are Arsenal fans and it's always a *classy* watch together",3
88,"If we win this, all we need is 2 wins vs Istanbul and a draw vs PSG or RB. Would really be something if we end up topping the group of death lol.",0
89,Absolute limbs across the world when Rashy scores a hatty against Fat Frank and brings a live child on the pitch and force feeds him to celebrate.,3
90,"If he isn't fit enough, hope Rashford isn't risked. We need him for Leipzig.",0
91,Anything other than 10-0 shows a steep decline in form..,3
92,AWB posted on insta that he got Cyberpunk from Project Red. I hope its just a case of him wanting a day off 😉,3
93,You just know we are winning tomorrow.,3
94,Paul Pogba the CB — only under Jose I’m afraid,3
95,"We can go as low as 18th. 

We can go as high as 11th.",3
96,">Pogba and Shaw are available, **no big injuries to note**

Been a while since i've read this",3
